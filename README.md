# BlackJack

The PDF file contains the intructions on how to play the game using terminal. 
It is important to use python3, as some features are not supported in python2. 
The game has only been tested on MacOS, therefore other OS might not be compatible. 

Any questions about how the game works? Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn.
Have fun!
